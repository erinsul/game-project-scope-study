# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss on Monday morning.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
      See the attached photo.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
      I expect the game board itself will have to be an array, since that is what the back-end server interprets. The game board itself looks like it will be easiest to have as some kind of objects (the game board array being nested inside, as well as a few other things.)
- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
      I'm honestly not sure how this question is different than the one above... The game board itself will be an array.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
      I plan to get all of the authentication working first, since that seems necessary to begin recording games.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
      As a user, I want to create an account to play and keep track of my scores.
      As a user, I want to be able to log into my account to access my information.
      As a user, I want to be able to play a game of tic tac toe so that I can have fun.
      As a user, I want to be able to be able to see my previous games played and my
      win-lose record so that I can remember all my victories.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
      I will mimic the usual file names we've been given/used in the past, tucking the js into an "assets" folder with multiple files to handle the ui/api requests and other things. And of course, the css will receive its own file.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
      Honestly not sure. Maybe adding some animation to the x and o placements on the board, but I'm not sure if that counts as creative enough.
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
      I will commit significant changes to the project every time they're made. I will probably make a checklist of what I consider major milestones (mostly that will consist of complete and working functions), and will commit each time I finish one of those.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
      If and ONLY IF I have time, I am interested in trying the bonus to allow two different users to play on separate devices.
